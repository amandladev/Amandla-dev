# Amandla dev!

Hi! I'm **Sergio Reyes**. I'm currently working as Front End Developer. I  like to use tools like P5, processing, Dall-e 2, Three.Js.
As you may have already guessed, I enjoy creating pieces of art through code.
I also  like literature, videogames and learning about crypto-technology.
